## Primary Business Problem
Management wants to understand how sales are performing across time, categories, regions, and payment methods in order to make allocation decisions (which categories/regions to push, and which to monitor).

### Sub-Problems I will answer
1. Revenue trends: Is total revenue growing, stable, or declining month to month?
2. Category performance: Which categories drive most of the revenue, and which are underperforming?
3. Regional performance: Are certain regions consistently stronger or weaker?
4. Payment method patterns: Are shifts in payment methods influencing revenue distribution?
5. Product concentration: Do a few products dominate revenue (Pareto risk)?
